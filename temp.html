                    <blockquote cite="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/">
                         Nearly 56% of the U.S. voting-age population cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election, representing a slight uptick
                        compared with 2012 but less than in the record year of 2008. While most Americans – 70% in a recent Pew Research Center survey
                        – say high turnout in presidential elections is very important, what constitutes “high turnout” depends very much on which
                        country you’re looking at and which measuring stick you use. The Census Bureau estimated that there were 245.5 million Americans
                        ages 18 and older in November 2016, about 157.6 million of whom reported being registered to vote. (While political scientists
                        typically define turnout as votes cast divided by the number of eligible voters, in practice turnout calculations usually
                        are based on the estimated voting-age population, or VAP.) Just over 137.5 million people told the census they voted in 2016,
                        somewhat higher than the actual number of votes tallied – nearly 136.8 million, according to figures compiled by the Office
                        of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, though that figure includes more than 170,000 blank, spoiled or otherwise
                        null ballots. That sort of overstatement has long been noted by researchers; the comparisons and charts in this analysis
                        use the House Clerk’s figure, along with data from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA)
                        and individual nations’ statistical and elections authorities. The 55.7% VAP turnout in 2016 puts the U.S. behind most of
                        its peers in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), most of whose members are highly developed,
                        democratic states. Looking at the most recent nationwide election in each OECD nation, the U.S. placed 26th out of 32 (current
                        VAP estimates weren’t available for three countries).

                        The political climate is not very inclusive at the moment in the United States, and I think the best way to make a difference
                        is to go out and vote for the candidate you think is right. 
                     </p>
                     
                        <h3>Why make an app about this?</h3><p>
                         If we make it for easier and streamline the process of voting, more people will turn out to vote and it is always a good
                        sign when more people come out and vote as politicians will be held more accountable, real change can be brought about and
                        the voice of the people will be loud and clear!
